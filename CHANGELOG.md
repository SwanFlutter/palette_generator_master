## About This Package

This package is a complete rewrite and enhancement of the discontinued `palette_generator` package (version 0.3.3+7). It provides advanced color palette extraction capabilities with modern Flutter development practices, accessibility support, and enhanced performance.

### Key Improvements Over Original Package

1. **Multi-Color Space Support**: Unlike the original RGB-only approach, this package supports RGB, HSV, and LAB color spaces for more accurate color analysis.

2. **Accessibility First**: Built-in WCAG 2.1 compliance checking and automatic accessible color pair generation.

3. **Color Harmony**: Automatic generation of harmonious color schemes based on color theory principles.

4. **Performance**: Significantly improved performance through optimized algorithms and memory management.

5. **Modern Flutter**: Built for Flutter 3.22.0+ with null safety and modern development practices.

6. **Comprehensive API**: More flexible and powerful API with extensive customization options.

### Future Roadmap

- [ ] Advanced color harmony algorithms (split-complementary, tetradic)
- [ ] Machine learning-based color palette suggestions
- [ ] Integration with popular design systems
- [ ] Advanced image analysis features
- [ ] Performance optimizations for large images
- [ ] Additional color space support (XYZ, LUV)
